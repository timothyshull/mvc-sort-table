#mvc-sort-table

This is a single page Vanilla (aside from the use of Require JS and Modernizr) JavaScript application. It loads JSON data to local storage, allows the user to sort by clicking headers, allows the user to add values, and dynamically paginates.

The structure for this app was modeled on the Vanilla TodoMVC app.
